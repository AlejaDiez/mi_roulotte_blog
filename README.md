# Mi Roulotte Blog

Mi Roulotte is a blog I created in 2017, when I was only 14 years old, after embarking on our first long journey across France. It was during this adventure that the idea of sharing our experiences and discoveries through an online space was born. Since then, Mi Roulotte has become a place where I capture and share my travel memories, inspiring others to explore and enjoy the world around us. I invite you to join this virtual journey and immerse yourself in the wonderful stories and moments I have experienced over the years.
